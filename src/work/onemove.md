OneMove is a web platform enabling local and independent moving companies within the OneMove Network to perform interstate moves. The platform's real-time pricing engine calculates the costs for freight transportation, origin and destination labor, and any additional services, and allows users to book shipments instantly.

We developed a web application for businesses in the OneMove Network, and a static site to acquire end-customers directly.
